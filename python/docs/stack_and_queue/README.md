# Stacks and Queues

Use a linked list as the underlying data storage mechanism to implement both a stack and a queue.

## Challenge

The challenge is to be able to push multiple values onto a stack, pop values off the stack, empty a stack after multiple pops, peek at the next item on the stack, instantiate a new stack, raise exceptions when popping and peeking, enqueue multiple values into a queue, dequeue out a queue, empty a queue after multiple dequeus, instantiante an empty queue, and raise exceptions when dequeing or peeking.

## Approach & Efficiency

My approach will be to create Node, stack, and queue classes, and add the push, pop, peek, and is empty methods to accomplish the challenges.

## API

There are no APIs used in this assignment.
