## Challenge Summary

This challenge the implementation of a graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods: add_node(), add_edge(, get_nodes(), get_neighbors(), and size().

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

## API

add_node(): this method
add_edge(): this method
get_nodes(): this method
