# 401 Data Structures, Code Challenges

## Insertion Sort

## Challenge Summary

The challenge for this assignment was to write a function that sorted a list using insertion sort, then return the sorted list's head.

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency

The approach to this challenge was to iterate through the list in multiple passes to place the node values in a temporary variable in a ascending order from left to right. The Big O time complexity is O(n^2) and space complexity for this approach is O(1).

## Solution

run tests using 'pytest'
