# 401 Data Structures, Code Challenges

## Hashtables

## Challenge Summary

This challenge was to implement a Hashtable Class with the set(), get(), contains(), keys(), and hash() methods.

## Approach & Efficiency

The approach for this challenge is to create the hash method then work through the set, get, contains, and keys methods. Tests for the code base was completed within hashtable.py as well as test_hashtable.py

The time and space efficiency for this challenge is O(1).

## API

set(): this method hashes the key and sets the key/value pair in the table.
get(): this method returns the value of the item with the specified key.
contains(): this method checks to see if a key/value pair exists in a dictionary.
key(): this method returns an object of all the keys in the dictionary.
hash(): this method returns the index value of the key.
