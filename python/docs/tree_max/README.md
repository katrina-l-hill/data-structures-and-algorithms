## Approach & Efficiency

The approach for this challenge was to define a method in the Binary Tree Class to find the maximum value by defining another method that took in the root and a value equal to zero and create if statements covering the values for root, left side, and right side compared to the max value found at that point.

## Solution

run tests using 'pytest'
