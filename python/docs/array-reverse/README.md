## Reverse an Array

This challenge was to write a function that took in an array as an argument and returned a new array with the elements reversed.

### Approach & Efficiency

My approach to this challenge was to visualize the arrays in reverse and identify a method that would appropriately reverse the array elements. The Big O space/time for this approach was to loop through the elements in the input order and figure out if there was no space to reverse the order from start to end.
