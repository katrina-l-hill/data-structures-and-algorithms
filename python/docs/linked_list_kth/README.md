# Data Structure: Extending an implementation

<!-- - Work within the existing data structure implementation
- Create a new method within the class that solves the code challenge
  - Remember, you'll have access to `self` within your class methods
- Tests
  - You will have folder named `tests` and within it, a test file called `test_[data_structure].py`
    - i.e. `tests/test_linked_list.py`
    - Add to the tests written for this data structure to cover your new method(s) -->

## Challenge Summary

Extend the linked list to allow various insertion methods, such as append, insert before, and insert after.

## Approach & Efficiency

The approach to this challenge was to start out with the Feature Tasks methods to get the intial functions created, then to move on to testing the functionality with the unit tests. This approach made the most sense as I was able to modify the functions to pass the tests. No Big O was determined for this approach.
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

## Solution

run tests using 'pytest'
