# Code Challenge / Trees

## Challenge

This challenge is designed to traverse through a Binary Tree class and a Binary Search Tree class. In the Binary Tree class, a method will be defined for each of the depth first traversals (pre-order, in-order, post-order) and return an array of ordered values in the post-order. In the Binary Search Tree class, methods will be created for Add and Contains. Both methods will take in an argument. The Add method will return nothing while the Containes method will return a Boolean for whether or not a value was in the tree.

## Approach & Efficiency

The approach for this challenge was to walk through the tree, node-to-node, and follow the path to traverse the depth. In addition, the Binary Search Tree followed the same approach but to see if a value was less or greater than the Node's value and where it should be added.
