# Code Challenge / Algorithm

Code challenges should be completed within a folder named `code_challenges` under the `python` level

- Daily Setup:
  - Create a new folder under the `python` level, with the name of the code challenge
    - Each code challenge assignment identifies the branch name to use, for example 'find-maximum-value'
    - For clarity, create your folder with the same name, ensuring that it's `snake_cased`
    - i.e. For a challenge named 'find_maximum_value', create the folder:`code_challenges/find_maximum_value`
  - Code Challenge Implementation
    - Each code challenge requires a function be written, for example "find maximum value"
    - Name the actual challenge file with the name of the challenge, in `snake_case`
      - i.e. `find_maximum_value.py`
    - Reminder: Your challenge file will then need to require the data structure you're using to implement
      - i.e. `from linked_list.linked_list import LinkedList`
    - Your challenge function name is up to you, but name something sensible that communicates the function's purpose. Obvious is better than clever
      - i.e. `find_maximum_value(linked_list)`
  - Tests
    - Ensure there is a `tests` folder at the root of project.
      - i.e. a sibling of this document.
    - within it, a test file called `test_[challenge].py`
      - i.e. `tests/find_maximum_value.py`
      - Your test file would require the challenge file found in the directory above, which has your exported function
        - i.e. `from code_challenges.find_maximum_value import find_maximum_value`

## Running Tests

If you setup your folders according to the above guidelines, running tests becomes a matter of deciding which tests you want to execute.  Jest does a good job at finding the test files that match what you specify in the test command

From the root of the `data-structures-and-algorithms/python` folder, execute the following commands:

- **Run every possible test** - `pytest`
- **Run filtered tests** - `pytest -k some_filter_text`
- **Run in watch mode** - `ptw` or `pytest-watch`
