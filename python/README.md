# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Language: `Python`

### Folder and Challenge Setup

Each type of code challenge has slightly different instructions. Please refer to the notes and examples below for instructions for each DS&A assignment type.

### Data Structure: New Implementation

- Create a new folder under the `python` level, with the name of the data structure and complete your implementation there
  - i.e. `linked_list`
- Implementation (the data structure "class")
  - The implementation of the data structure should match package name
    - i.e. `linked_list/linked_list.py`
  - Follow Python [naming conventions](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#naming-conventions)

    ```python
    class LinkedList:
      def __init__(self):
        # ... initialization code

      def method_name(self):
        # method body
    ```

- Tests
  - Within folder `tests` create a test file called `test_[data_structure].py`
    - i.e. `tests/test_linked_list.py`
    - Your tests will then need to require the data structure you're testing
      - i.e. `from linked_list.linked_list import LinkedList`

## Singly Linked List

### Challenge

This challenge was designed to test singly linked lists.

### Approach & Efficiency

The approach taken for this challenge was to work through the tests indivdually and define functions that would solve the tests.

### API
